    "The reason for this result is as follows: when `or` and `and` are used together, `and` is evaluated first. The statement \"True and False\" will return a `False` result. Why? Because a true statement and a false statement cannot be true together, their result is false. Another way of thinking about this is the binary values, 0 and 1, where 0 represents `False` and 1 represents `True`. The `and` acts as a multiplication of sorts (this shouldn't come as a surprise since multiplication is done before addition), and we know that 1 $\\times$ 0 = 0, thus \"True and False\" is `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the `and` was evaluated and gave a `False` result, when you consider \"True or False\", the result is `True` since if at least one statement is true in an or statement, the result is automatically `True`. It also helps to think of `or` as an addition of sorts and thus 1 + 0 = 1, thus \"True or False\" is `True`.\n",
