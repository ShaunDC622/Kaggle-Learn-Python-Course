This repository contains the Jupyter Notebooks I made while learning through the course "Learn Python" on the Kaggle website; the link is https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python

The files are based on the Tutorials and accompanying Exercises for each of the sections (7 in total). Some of the text and structure follows closely to the what is found on the Kaggle course; I do not claim to have 100% creative rights to them. 
I was inspired to create my notebooks based on them since they serve as an avenue of my own self-learning; some parts remain the same to original material, whereas other parts are changed to suit me better (I might decide to go back to them in the future to make them more authentically my own).

If you decide you'd like to have the notebooks for you're own, feel free to make a copy for yourself, but please DO NOT copy or edit the originals I've uploaded to the repository. Happy Python learning and engaging!
